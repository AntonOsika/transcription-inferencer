super clean and simple app where you let me upload a file that is sent for transcription to openai over http

show the transcription results in a textbox

then trigger a call to gpt 3.5 with the text and ask it to infer what was said and add nice formatting to the text, and show this in a second textbox (use a toast when each call triggers)

let user provide an API key thats stored in localstorage
